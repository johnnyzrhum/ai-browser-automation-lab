## ⚡ Workflow (Arc + ChatGPT)
1. **Scope it** — define the question, audience, and “decision needed”.
2. **Search set** — open 6–10 candidate tabs in Arc (docs, vendors, news, 1–2 skeptics).
3. **Skim & save** — use Arc split views; copy key quotes/links into a scratch note (you can use Arc's Easles feature).
4. **Summarize** — feed quotes + links to AI with the **Arc Research Prompt** (below).
5. **Synthesize** — AI outputs: TL;DR, 3–5 insights, risks, decision options, sources.
