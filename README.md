# AI Browser Automation Lab

This project explores how AI-enhanced browsers like [Arc](https://arc.net) and [Diagram (Dia)](https://diagram.com/dia) can be used for workflow acceleration, research, and interface design.

## 🧪 Focus Areas

- ⚡ Arc: Automating research, content filtering, memory recall, and summarization
- 🧠 Dia: AI-assisted workflows, site architecture, UI pattern generation

---

## 🗂️ Structure

- `workflows/`: Sample use cases and walkthroughs
- `prompts/`: Prompt engineering patterns and templates
- `assets/`: Visual aids and architecture diagrams

## 🔮 Why This Matters

As browsers become more intelligent, they can offload cognitive and mechanical work — becoming creative partners in product thinking, UX, and marketing.
